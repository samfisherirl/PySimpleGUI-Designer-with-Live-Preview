# SimpleGUIDesigner with Live Preview

Live preview is the main feature Im looking to integrate and provide. Its not fully flushed out, releases without live updates are available.

This is a fork from the original here: https://github.com/PriestTheBeast/SimpleGUIBuilder

Throughout my experience with software development, I have found Autohotkey to be a remarkably user-friendly and accessible tool, serving as a beacon of excellence for mid to low-level use cases. Conversely, as a newcomer to the language, I have found the Qt framework to be somewhat challenging to approach. While not insurmountable, the learning curve can prove daunting. It is for this reason that I have taken an interest in the PySimpleGUI model, as it enables a streamlined transition from visual design to code implementation.

As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking out new and innovative approaches to mastering software development. With this in mind, I would be delighted to share my insights with others and contribute to the broader community. Although my current project is in its nascent stages, I am thrilled to witness its evolution and growth.

With this, Im looking to provid themes, and small tweaks to improve consistance, ease of use, and QOL. 

    -Exports now include full code

    -Reset button to restore default code when you need a north star

    -Full theme list applied to both the GUIDesigner and the export

Future ideas (open to feedback) and todos:

    -EXE release

    -Insert links to pysimplegui docs for individual elements

    -Dependency properties per element
     
    -icon buttons 
    
    - Live preview

# SimpleGUIDesigner with Themes

This is a fork from the original here: https://github.com/PriestTheBeast/SimpleGUIBuilder

With this, Im looking to provid themes, and small tweaks to improve consistance, ease of use, and QOL. 

    -Exports now include full code

    -Reset button to restore default code when you need a north star

    -Full theme list applied to both the GUIDesigner and the export

Future ideas (open to feedback) and todos:

    -EXE release

    -Insert links to pysimplegui docs for individual elements

     -Dependency properties per element
     
     -icon buttons
